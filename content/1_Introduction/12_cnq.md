## 1. Overview
Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ) on AWS is the only file data service that offers the performance and scale your most demanding workloads need, at a comparable total cost of ownership to on-premises storage.

CNQ was engineered specifically to leverage native cloud compute, object storage, and networking resources to create the only fully scalable, fully elastic file and object data service available on AWS today. CNQ’s fully customizable architecture can be configured for the specific capacity, throughput, and IOPS requirements of virtually any file or object based workload. It also means that CNQ can deliver comparable performance and services to on-premises file storage, and at a similar TCO.

Beyond the inherent scalability and dynamic elasticity in every deployment, CNQ supports enterprise-class features such snapshots,replication, quotas, and multi-protocol support – NFS, SMB, REST and S3 – for all your data. 

CNQ is also the only file service on AWS that can run in any
AWS Local Zone as easily as in any AWS region worldwide,
giving even your on-premises data centers the fastest possible
access to your data. Within those regions or local zones CNQ can be deployed in a Single Availablity Zone (SAZ) or for production worloads or those instances where availablity is paramount CNQ can be deployed in a Multi-Availablity configuration without the need to duplicate data.


## 2. Cloud-Native Qumulo Architecture
Cloud-Native Qumulo (CNQ) can deploy as a Single-Availablity Zone (SAZ) or Multi-Availablity Zone (MAZ) Deployment

## 3. Disruptive features without disruptions
CNQ can also be dynamically reconfigured without taking services offline, so you can boost performance temporarily as needed, or permanently if your workloads change. A CNQ instance originally deployed as a disaster recovery or archive target can be converted from a low-cost, high-capacity service to a high-performance data platform in seconds.

If you already use Qumulo storage on-premises or in other cloud platforms, Qumulo’s native replication services enable seamless movement of data between your on-premises, edge, and AWS based deployments, letting you build a follow-the-sun workflow or to move files through a large-scale data pipeline. 

Use continuous replication for disaster recovery scenarios, or combine replication with Qumulo’s snapshot feature to protect older versions of critical data from loss or ransomware.
