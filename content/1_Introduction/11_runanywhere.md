# **Qumulo RunAnywhere Architecture**


## **Section 1: Introduction to Qumulo RunAnywhere**  

Qumulo‚Äôs RunAnywhere architecture allows the file data platform to run consistently across cloud, edge, and on-prem environments. This flexibility is central to enabling hybrid workflows ‚Äî giving organizations the power to process, move, and manage data wherever it makes the most business sense.

  üó£Ô∏è "RunAnywhere is mostly around how this helps extend and connect hybrid workloads to make it easier to drive in the cloud ‚Äî from the flexibility of the hardware that we provide."
