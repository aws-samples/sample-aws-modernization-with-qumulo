## 1. Overview
RunAnywhere is Qumulo’s deployment flexibility program that allows Qumulo software to run on:
+ Certified OEM hardware (HPE, Arrow, Supermicro, etc.)
+ Customer-qualified servers (with Qumulo validation)
+ Public cloud platforms such as AWS through Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ)
+ Instead of being locked into a single appliance model, RunAnywhere gives organizations freedom of choice while ensuring the same features, user experience, and performance across all environments.
