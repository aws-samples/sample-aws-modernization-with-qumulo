# **Cloud Data Fabric**  

## **Introduction**  
Modern data environments span **on-premises infrastructure, public cloud, and hybrid architectures**. Managing data across these environments efficiently—without compromising performance, security, or accessibility—is a critical challenge.  

**Cloud Data Fabric (CDF)** is Qumulo’s solution to **unifying data management across multiple locations**, enabling seamless **data movement, access, and control** between **on-prem and cloud storage**. With CDF, organizations can ensure **data availability** wherever it is needed, while leveraging **cloud scalability and cost efficiency**.

This module explores how **CDF enables hybrid and multi-cloud data workflows**, ensuring **high performance, security, and ease of management**.
