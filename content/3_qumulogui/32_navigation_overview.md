The Qumulo GUI is organized into logical sections that provide intuitive access to all management functions. Let's explore the interface layout and understand how to navigate between different areas.

## Interface Layout

The Qumulo interface follows a clean, modern design with consistent navigation elements:

### Top Header Bar
- **Settings** - Global system configuration options
- **Notifications** - System alerts and status messages
- **Help** - Access to documentation and support resources  
- **User Profile** - Account settings and logout options

### Main Navigation Tabs

The primary navigation is organized across the top of the interface with these main sections:

- **Dashboard** - Main overview and system metrics
- **Analytics** - Performance monitoring and detailed reporting
- **Sharing** - NFS exports, SMB shares, and S3 buckets
- **Cluster** - System administration and configuration
- **APIs & Tools** - Developer resources and automation tools
- **Support** - Help documentation and troubleshooting resources

## Dashboard: Your Mission Control

The dashboard serves as your primary view into cluster health and activity:

### Cluster Overview

Displays real-time metrics including:
- Storage capacity and utilization
- Metadata overview information

### Activity Panel
![Activity](/static/images/qumulogui/32_03.png)

Shows current system activity:
- File operations in progress
- Throughput, IOPS, and Latency details

### Historical Data Controls

Use the time selector to view:
- **Last 24 hours** (default view)
- **Custom date ranges** for historical analysis
- **Real-time updates** as data changes

## Navigation Tips

- **Tab-based navigation** makes it easy to switch between functional areas
- **Sub-menus** appear within each main section for specific tasks
- **Breadcrumb trails** help you track your location within nested views
- **Context menus** provide quick access to common actions

## Practice Exercise

Take a few minutes to:

1. **Click through each main tab** - Explore what's available in Dashboard, Analytics, Sharing, etc.
2. **Return to the Dashboard** - Notice how it updates with live data from your load testing
3. **Change the time range** - Observe how historical views change the displayed metrics
4. **Navigate between sections** - Get comfortable with the tab-based structure

✅ **Key Takeaway:** Use the Dashboard as your **mission control** for quick health checks, troubleshooting, and high-level monitoring. The tab-based navigation makes it easy to move between administrative tasks.

**Next:** Proceed to **Section 3.3 – File System Explorer** where we'll dive into browsing and managing your cluster's directory structure.
